Health Heros is a website dedicated to initializing good health habits to the young ones from a young age. 
It contains challenges that motivate the young ones to stay and eat health.
It contains reward points and a challenge scoreboard for the child to always stay up to the challenge.
The parents/guardians also have a panel where they can watch their childrens milestones and interactivity.
